openCaesar3 is a remake of the classic Caesar3 PC game, a city building game developed by Impression Games and published by Sierra Entertainment, in 1998.

The game will be a near clone to the original Caesar3 game. Notorious changes are:
 * new AI for walkers. They just go where they are needed
 * actors just out of the actor school do not provide access to the entertainment (same for gladiators, ...)

The game is still not quite playable
