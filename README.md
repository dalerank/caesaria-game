openCaesar3
===========
openCaesar3 is a remake of the classic Caesar3 PC game, a city building game developed by Impression Games and published by Sierra Entertainment, in 1998.

The game will be a near clone of the original Caesar3 game. Notable changes are:
 * A new AI for walkers. They just go where they are needed.
 * Actors coming from the actor school do not provide access to the entertainment. The same goes for lion tamers, gladiators and horse wagons.

The game is currently under heavy development and not in a playable state. Developers are invited to participate.
