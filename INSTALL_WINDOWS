                     Installation of openCaesar3 on Microsoft Windows


1. Install the original Caesar3 game. Pictures and maps are needed for openCaesar3

2. Download and extract openCaesar3

3. Launch the sgreader.exe
      select "File", "Batch extract"
      set the "Input Folder" as instructed
      choose C3.exe, C3_North.sg2, C3_south.sg2
      wait until done
      you will have 3 folders created: C3, C3_North and C3_South

4. Rename all *.png files to lowercase in all 3 folders (C3, C3_North and C3_South)
      Several tools are available on the internet for this, for example:
      * BulkReaderUtility, http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/
      * TotalCommander, http://www.ghisler.com/

5. Pack all files from C3 folder into pics.zip, from C3_North to pics_north.zip, from C3_South to pics_south.zip
      move these 3 zip files to openCaesar3/pics
      Several tools are available on the internet for this, for example:
      * 7zip, http://www.7-zip.org/. You may need to use the ".bzip2" compression.

6. From your Caesar3 install dir, copy *.map to resources/maps/

7. Run caesar.exe
      in case of error, check the stdout.txt file in the openCaesar3 directory for clues.
