I grant you a huge, rich province in which to accomplish this.\n The Peace requirement might cause you some difficulty. Far from verging on Roman citizenship, many Gallic tribes remain mired in the most primitive barbarism. They will not peacefully watch Rome civilize their ancestral lands.

I take this personally.\nYour colleague in Caesarea proved to be little more than a common thief. The fool pocketed all of the denarii that his account books showed being spent on prefectures and prefect salaries. His fraud caused exactly the problems you would expect of a city without prefects. He was hardly as clever as he thought himself!\nThis former governor now rots in the Mammertine Prison. It amuses me to tie his fate to that of Caesarea.\nYou, my most promising governor, will take over Caesarea. Restore the city to its former glory, and achieve the ratings I've defined for you. If you can undo the harm that its previous governor caused, I will show him mercy, and merely exile him from the Empire. If you cannot save Caesarea, he will die as slowly and painfully as did his former city. Needless to say, I will be sorely disappointed in you if you stumble. I take my governors' failures personally, too.\nOh, besides the problems stemming from mismanagement, our old foes the Numidians are still active in the region. Don't neglect the city's defense.
